```
(I did it for love)
Ride the highway, ride the bus
(Rock it, rock it)
Why my house look like Army
Plus?
(Rake it up, rake it up)
Walk in the strip, she gon'
make it bust
(Bust it, woo, bust it)
I do damage
(Bust it)
You niggas can't stand it
(Bust it)
Psycho bandit
(Bust it)
Like it's Marilyn Manson
(Bust it)
Got the cash, advance it
(Bust it)
Get the Sprite and enhance it
(Bust it)
Pull the Wock' out the pantry
(Bust it)
Take a sip and I'm dancin'
(Bust it)
She pop Perc' like a Plan B
(Bust it)
Oh, she lit like a candle
(Candle)
Boot it up in the car seat
(Car seat)
Hold a nigga for ransom
(Ransom)
Want her back? Better call me
(Bust it)
It's whatever, I'm geeked
(Geeked)
Bout to punch out thе party
(Woo)
You niggas ain't fly, this shit
lookin' dummy
(Yeah)
I'm popped to get friеd,
I look
like a mummy
(Bust it)
I'm gettin' this cash, it's
Monday to Sunday
I guess you won't talk if it
ain't about the money
(Bust it)
My boys in the trap, and they
jump like a bunny
Got pounds and pills, it ain't
nothin' funny
I fuck from the side and I keep
the bitch cummin'
If I gotta reach up, I'ma keep
the bitch dummy
Way I slide in that coupe, boy,
I keep that bitch hummin'
(Yeah)
We done went and rocked that
bitch all the way to the summer
Get deep in the pot, get deep
like a plumber
(Deep)
Why would I keep her? I never
will loved her
(No)

(Yeah)
Eat her for dinner or eat her
for supper
(Yeah)
Why would you keep her lil'
nigga, you sucker?
Why would you keep her lil'
nigga, you suck?
(Lil' nigga, you suck)
(I did it for love)
Ride the highway, ride the bus
(Rock it, rock it)
Why my house look like Army
Plus?
(Rake it up, rake it up)
Walk in the strip, she gon'
make it bust
(Bust it, bust it)
I do damage
(Bust it)
You niggas can't stand it
