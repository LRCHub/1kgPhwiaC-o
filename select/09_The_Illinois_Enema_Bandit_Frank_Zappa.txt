The Illinois Enema Bandit
I heard he's on the loose

Of all them college-educated women
Boy, he'd just be tyin' 'em up
They'd be all bound down!
Just be pumpin' every one of 'em
Up with all the bag fulla

I heard it on the news
I heard it on the news
Bloomington Illinoishe has caused some alarm
Just sneakin' around there from farm to farm
Got a rubberized bag and a hose on his arm
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump

One day he'll have to pay
One day he'll have to pay
The police will say, "You're under arrest!"
And the judge would have him
For a special guest
The DA will order a secret test
And stuff his pudgy little thumbs in
The side of his vest
Then they'll put out a call
For the jury folks (That's you over there)
And the judge would say, "No poo-poo jokes!"
Then they'll drag in the bandit
For all to see
Sayin' "Don't nobody have no sympathy
HOT SOAPY WATER in the FIRST DEGREE!"
And then the bandit might say
"Why is everybody looking' at me?"
Well did you cause this misery?
Well did you cause this kinda misery?
Well did you cause this misery?
Now, one girl shout: "Let the Bandit be!"
Bandit are you guilty?
Bandit are you guilty? tell me now, what's
YOUR PLEA?
Another girl shout: "Let the fiend go free!"
Are you guilty? bandit
Did you do these deeds? (C'mon now)
He said, "It must be just what they all need"

"It must be just what they all need"
"It must be just what they all need"
